# Flicks

# Project 1 - Flicks

Flicks is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: ~28 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [x] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [x] User can search for a movie.
- [x] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [x] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Added a launch screen that has the logo and name of app
- [x] Tried to add an icon for the app

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to convert between collectionView and TableView
2. Common errors with Xcode. Xcode can be very frustrating at times. I want a tutorial on Xcode to make it simple.

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Using Xcode was a big challenge. Layering in Xcode is a nightmare.
Switching between collectionView and tableView was hard.
Adding icons to apps did not work for me.
Also had an issue with the ProgressBar cocoapod; need to understand documentation in Swift better.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I didn't have many challenges. Time was certainly an issue since it was the first week of school.
